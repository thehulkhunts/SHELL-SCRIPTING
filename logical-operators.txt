  So, what do you meant by logical operators ?
  check the conditions and execute the statements .

  
 what are logical operators available in shell scripting ?

 1) AND - operator   && and  -a 
 2) OR -  operator   || and  -o
 3) NOT - operator   ! and   -n  


       AND (-a)              OR (-o)                NOT (!)
    
  T - T = T       T - T = T               F T  IF IT IS FALSE THEN IT WILL BE TRUE
  T - F = F       T - F = T               T F  IF IT IS TRUE THEN IT WILL BE FALSE 
  F - T = F       F - T = T
  F - F = F       F - F = F
