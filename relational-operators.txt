 So, what are relational operators ?
 
1)  less than                         -lt   or    <
2)  less than or equal to             -le   or    <=
3)  greater than                      -gt   or    >
4)  greater than or equal to          -ge   or   >=
5)  not equal                         -ne   or   !=
6)  equal to                          -eq   or    =
